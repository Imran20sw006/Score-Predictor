Title of CEP Project of DS-A
"T20 Cricket Score Predictor".
Description Of Project
Our project is centered around developing a sophisticated T20 Score Predictor, a tool designed to forecast outcomes in T20 cricket matches with a high degree of accuracy. To achieve this, we initiated with a crucial stepâ€”data preparation. We sourced our dataset from Kaggle's Cricsheet, a reputable cricket statistics repository, and meticulously refined it. This involved cleaning the data to rectify any discrepancies or missing information, and selecting key features essential for prediction, focusing on player performance metrics and match details. We transformed the dataset by scaling numerical features and encoding categorical variables, making it compatible with the XGBoost algorithm, our chosen predictive modeling technique. The predictive model, underpinned by this meticulously prepared dataset, is a powerful tool that provides valuable insights and predictions for T20 cricket matches. It not only enhances the cricket experience for enthusiasts but also holds immense potential for strategic decision-making and informed engagement within the vibrant T20 cricket arena. The success of this project underscores the critical role of comprehensive data preparation in enabling the creation of accurate and effective predictive models.
